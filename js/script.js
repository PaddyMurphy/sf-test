You will build a "Hardcore Produce" leaderboard, which is a list of the
top five hardcore fruit & veggie names paired with the number of times
that they have been mentioned on Twitter or Facebook.

For simplicity's sake, we've stubbed out an API interface within a library
 (see api.js). The library provides a Poller() class with a .poll() method.
 This method will poll for the top names of the type of produce requested
 in each poll ('fruits' or 'veggies').

Your task is to use the poll method to implement a solution that handles
multiple asynchronous responses to build the "Hardcore Produce" leaderboard.
The leaderboard that you build should satisfy these basic requirements:

Visually adhere to the provided PSD.
Every 15 seconds, update the leaderboard to show the latest produce names and
counts, sorted descending by count.
The resulting leaderboard should be a mix of both fruits and veggies.
Bonus: Animate the leaderboard update in some way (fade/dissolve, sliding, etc.).
Bonus: Make the leaderboard a responsive design that displays nicely on smaller screens.
